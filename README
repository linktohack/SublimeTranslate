## What is this?
The name should make sense :D

## How to install
git clone https://github.com/linktohack/Sublime-GoogleTranslate.git GoogleTranslate
cd GoogleTranslate
git submodule init
git submodule update

or clone the submodule manually (if the above code do nothing)

cd GoogleTranslate
git submodule add https://github.com/linktohack/google-translate-python.git google_translate_python

## Usage
The default key binding is Ctrl+Alt+T.

Select the text you want to translate and hit the default key et.. voila!

## Customize
We have to choices of configuration:

1. Default behavior via settings
Type: `Google` into the Command Palette... and open both Preference file. Copy
the value from the Default settings to the custom one and edit to your like.

2. Via Key binding arguments:
Type `Google` into the Command Palette... and open the Default Key binding
file. Copy the value to your custom Key biding and edit to your like.

There is 3 arguments that can be edited in both way:

*`from_lang`*: language to be translated from
*`to_lang`*: language to translate into
*`extend`*: boolean: If false, the translated text will be placed right at the
position of the old text (that should look better in most case.) Otherwise, it
will be add after the old text (if you would look carefully in to both
original and translated text.)
